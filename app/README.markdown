Work:
    Work was done by Terry James using the content provided and nothing additional.

About:
    A one page application created using HTML, JQuery, JavaScript, and CSS.

Server:
    No changes where made to how to access this page from the original Readme file.

HTML:
    The page is created using various Divs one overall div with two column divs for the tabs on the left and the text for each tab on the right. All JavaScript and CSS was contained externally in seperate files.

JavaScript:
    Only the Dynamic Content uses JavaScript. JQuery was used to shorten the amount of words and lines needed to access classes and ids. Also, it was used for the ability to hide and show elements as needed. 

CSS:
    Contained in a seperate file for easy maintenance and changes to HTML elements.

Dynamic Content:
    This part is done by first making an Ajax call to the provided JSON file for the friends information. Next the script counts the number of people that are on the current step which is passed as a parameter to function. After the count the script then identifies which output it needs to display based on an if statement that is used to create the correct formation for displaying the results. The Ajax call, counting, and information checking is done every time one of the step tabs is clicked.
